# Worthwhile Knockdowns

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Knockdowns are more meaningful now. Mechs that just stood up cannot sprint nor jump anymore.

## Gameplay changes
- Knockdowned Mechs do not only get the ToHit-Penalty from Vanilla but can also only perform a regular move
	- Sprints and jumps are just too demanding for a unit that just managed to get up its feet
	- Info panel shows appropiate warnings
    - As of version 1.9.1 this is now configurable

## Additional notes
* Fixes small vanilla inconvenience with showing a sprint warning because of UNSTEADY while Mech was still prone
* Edits descriptions of SPRINT and JUMP in CODE. This is not localization safe.
